Backdoor Project

Introduction:
This project implements a simple backdoor functionality using Python sockets. It consists of two main files:

backdoor.py: 
This file contains the code for the client-side component of the backdoor, which establishes a connection to a remote server and allows the execution of commands on the host system.

server.py:
This file contains the code for the server-side component, which listens for incoming connections from client backdoors and manages command execution and file transfers.

Features:
Remote Command Execution: Execute shell commands on the target system remotely.
File Upload/Download: Upload and download files between the target system and the server.
Persistent Connection: The backdoor maintains a persistent connection to the server, allowing continuous communication and control.

Usage:
Ensure Python is installed on both the server and client systems.
Run server.py on the system you want to act as the command and control server.
Modify the IP address and port in backdoor.py to match the server's IP and port.
Run backdoor.py on the target system you want to control.
Once the connection is established, use the server console to send commands to the client backdoor.
